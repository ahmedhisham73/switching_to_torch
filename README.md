# switching_to_torch
this repository is set to give strong hands on using PyTorch over tensorflow 
the repository structure is set to be as follow :

1-simple tensor for checking GPU if available and PyTorch is correctly installed with GPU support or not , in addition to perform simple basic tensor operations 
2-Neural networks basics which demonstrates the usage of the NN ( neural network ) module built in PyTorch 
3-torch training which contains the demonstration of basic CNN and transfer learning with CPU and GPU training , in addition to saving and restoring model for inference
4-torch CNN contains the CNN models that will be trained for Visual classification , detection and segmentation tasks
